# Térûvia, Our Home
Térûvia is a world within the material plane. Any knowledge of society in Térûvia from before the "Calamity" are nonexistent.

In the early days those who remained after the Cataclysm gathered together to form primitive civilizations, claiming space, and entering conflicts for centuries. However all of that was changed when magic awakened in 695, a few select people were able to manipulate it, and did with it a variety of things from helping their communities, to using it for financial gain, and some using it to concentrate power. 

On the Mainland there were many initial warring factions but eventually united under three mighty nations, the Kolians of the mountains, the Eshean of the plains, and the Vekzs of the southern shore. These three factions would war since the earliest history and for over 500 years. At the beginning of the dawn of magic each nation was embroiled in a magical arms race as began to fight with magic and all sides saw casualties increase exponentially in what was known as Arcanageddon, realizing this was no way to grow and thrive, an armistice between the nations was struck in 875. The rulers of the 3 nations met and divided up the main land in a way that everyone was content with; to give the Vekzs the fertile valley, the Kols the bountiful mines in the mountains, and the Esheans the dense forests and bountiful plains. The nations also dedicated the Northern Ridge to the Gods, declaring it Charbotia, a nation independent, and a recognized Holy Land for any follower to inhabit. The Northern Ridge is some of the most breathtaking landscape there is with the forests and mountains leading to a beautiful coast, all of it dotted with temples to the various Gods that make up Térûvia's Pantheon. This area is one where you can find any and every one as the only requirement to be a citizen is to worship.  Peace has been had on the mainland for near 300 years, but across the Térûvian Sea it has not been the case.

While this happened on the mainland two other civilizations grew into their own places and struggled to coexist on the Eastern Ridge. The Arkhans in the North started as a few loosely connected settlements but were soon unified under their Sultan Jafar, who gained their riches from the salt fields on the Western coast and the oil fields in the desert which he used to raise an army. The Wincladans are a union of tribes that lived in the dense dangerous forests and jungles in the South. The Arkhans and the Wincladans have fought in the past for control of the Plains of Ashanbi, the most fertile land in all of the Eastern Ridge. Initially they used magic in their wars with no sign of stopping but were swayed into observing the armistice in 957, when the three nations of the mainland applied pressure with their unified armies. While in relative peace the tensions are as always high between the two nations on the Eastern Ridge.

On the Southern Ridge you will find the lands of Eboria, a melting pot formed by the collection of castoff that didn't fit into Térûvian Society on the mainland, or didn't enjoy the tension on the Eastern Ridge. The Southern Ridge has a wonderful coast that sharply raises to the peaks of the mountains there. Here you will find just about anyone who doesn’t enjoy the cultures around the rest of Térûvia. It is the newest nation to join the armistice.


In 1000, to celebrate the dawn of a new time and millennia, the Enclave was declared a true neutral ground where each of the nations observing the armistice could send their best and brightest to grow and learn among the different cultures. Inside the city there is a keep where each of the nations has sent a representative to negotiate on their nations behalf, for any matters that need to be handled. The city also houses the Enclave Academy where the brightest minds teach the future scholars of tomorrow. The greatest market in all the land with the finest craftmanship is found at the Bazaar. There is also the Coliseum inside where the nations pay tribute to their warring past by sending champions to fight for their nation. With the Enclave formed the nations sought to protect their lands from growing threats in the wild, and began the Adventurer's Program, a certification and support system to ensure the lands are protected.

It is now Fall 1, 1069 and you have answered the call, coming from your little corner of Térûvia to come to the Enclave for the decennial issuing of new Adventurers Cards in the hopes of joining the 1070 class of new adventurers. To gain your adventurer card you must prove your worth by assembling a team and completing the Adventurer Test. You will choose what to display to prove your adventuring aptitude, for an adventurer need not be the best at EVERY thing but instead, be the best at THEIR thing.

If you pass the Adventurer Test then you may go forth and reap all the rewards that come with being a Adventurer, along with all of the dangers that may bring. Be careful out there as you help keep the lands safe from those who wish evil to be done to the citizens of our lands.

# Kolian Kingdom

The Kolians are a stoic nation that survives in the height of the mountains not because they have to but because they feel at home in struggle. Some of the greatest craftsmen have come out of this society, likely from the pressure leading to innovation. These ones were most likely the basis for the Nordic people in the fantastical tales told by B.J. Humpcraft. 

The Dwarven Feldar Family bloodline has ruled since the Armistice was formed, current King is Ragnar Feldar VIII. The King lives in the castle Feldarholmr within the capitol with a cabinet of advisors chosen by the Monarch. The Feldar family was known for uniting the now Kolians against the Esheans before the armistice and were rewarded with the monarchy for ensuring their survival. The Monarch is mostly a ceremonial position as they have decided the representative for the Enclave is elected by the people.

# Eshean Empire

The Esheans are a proud nation of fierce warriors and influential artists, but not all warriors fight with their bodies, for the renowned Philosophers that argue in the court of Romana are just as revered as the Gladiators that fight next door in the coliseum. Their culture was likely the influence for Ancient Romans and Greeks in the renowned fiction author B.J. Humpcraft's series of books.

Three Royal Families recognized the Ek'Sha Orc bloodline, Fus'Roh Dragonborn bloodline, and the Nar'Nayan bloodline of the Leonin. Current ruler is Rok Ek'Sha and has been seated since he won the seat almost 50 years ago. Upon death of the monarch all eligible heirs (18-36) participate in a set of trials combining mental, physical, and artistic abilities, since the Esheans put pride in the beaty of war, debate, and art. Winner is crowned king, while others sit on the Court to serve as advisors. Generals are appointed to keep order in the burgs by the monarch, by proving strength both mental and physical.

# Vekzian Dominion

Description

The High Vekz is the title of the ruler of the Vekzian Dominion. A spiritual successor chosen by the current High Vekz, whom was chosen by the previous. Those that show affinity for the gifts of the High Vekz are sent to Tal'Dorei to join the Mercer Academy where they learn the rites and rituals related to the High Vekz and their traditions, although only one is chosen they can be chosen at anytime, as the High Vekz will know when their successor is ready. Those that are unchosen are still set up to be the leaders of their communities.
    
The Veks are a neat and tidy people known to not be seen with nary a hair out of place. Let you in on a secret, they made us put the clothes in the bag so the adventurers always looked presentable. Most of them are kinda stuck up but that's likely due to them finding much outsiders are concerned with trivial as they have almost triple the lifespan of the other races whom all live to 80/100 while the average fey touched creatures found here are known to regularly reach 240 to almost 300.
