# Character Creation

</div>

*The guidelines for character creation are as follows:*

* **Level: 3**, accompanied with a level appropriate, one paragraph to one page, backstory.
* **Hit Dice.** Use the average.
* **Ability Scores:** Go to *#stat-gen* in the Discord and enter `!rr 6 4d6pl1`, arrange as desired. Re-roll the whole lot if they don't add up to at least 70.
* **Equipment:** One *Uncommon* Magic Item tied to your backstory, along with your standard starting equipment, open to your ideas for weapon customization for flavor.
* **Classes.** Any official WOTC 5e content or specified Homebrew. 2 classes max.
* **Races.** Any listed race and all their variants/halfs. Nation is just a suggestion, but remember how being different might affect your character.

 >*Reach out for any additional details about big picture stuff, feel free to give their home some life with small details that you feel fit the area. Compelling characters have flaws, so play into your weaknesses not just strengths. Secrets are encouraged about your past to keep from the party, and even some you might give me the opprotunity to keep from you. Don't feel bound by the burgs given for there are plenty of not officially named smaller settlements peppered all throughout Térûvia that could have as few as 10 to as many as a couple hundred people. While you can have grand ideas for your character remember you are currently level 3 so keep the exploits local.*
