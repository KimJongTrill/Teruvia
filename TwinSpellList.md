Updated Sorcerer Twinned Spell spell list. This is compiled list of all of the spells that can benefit from ***a very strict reading*** of the Twinned Spell metamagic that are available to the Sorcerer and Sorcerer subclasses.

Notes are in brackets, indicating limitations on how it qualifies (usually what subclass it is available to, or that it must be cast at it's base level because upcasting targets multiple creatures). Let me know any errors you find, and I'll update the list.

***Notes:***

*The 'very strict reading of' the rules includes the designer intentions outlined in* [Sage Advice](https://media.wizards.com/2020/dnd/downloads/SA-Compendium.pdf)*. RAI is often stupid. The intention here was to write up a list that would match both, so that no spell on the list could be rejected by overzealous DMs.*

*Removed Firebolt, True Strike, Ceremony, Levitate, Enlarge/Reduce, Gentle Repose, Remove Curse, Dispel Magic, Blight and Disintegrate based on the SA compendium outlines on their ability to target objects.*
